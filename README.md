# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The API can be accessed locally from a separate repository [here](https://github.com/guacajoely/cdl-predictor-api) and then ran with the terminal command: 

`json-server -p 8088 -w database.json`

**-or-**

the API is currently deployed on Digital Ocean [here](https://cdl-predictor-api-huee9.ondigitalocean.app/)

Once you've confirmed you have access to one of the APIs (and checked that the correct API location is linked in ApiManager), you can launch the app with the terminal command:

`npm start`

And open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
